# NexusLIMS Addition: Redis-backed caching for production
# Base MDCS uses Django's default LocMemCache, but we use Redis for:
# - Better performance with persistent cache across container restarts
# - Shared cache across multiple app instances (if scaled horizontally)
# - Session storage that survives application restarts
# Required by: config/settings/prod_settings.py
